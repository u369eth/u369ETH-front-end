            <strong>Security:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no vulnerabilities nor attack vectors at the protocol
            level.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is impossible to steal the native token(s) locked within the u369
            smart contract, and it is impossible to steal the uTokens which are
            minted at 1:1 ratio in regards to the locked native tokens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Locked native tokens can be unlocked at any time and only by burning
            uTokens.

            <strong>Programmed distribution:</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If ETH market cap is, for example 369B, and if within this smart
            contract, less than ~1% of 369B is locked (let's say 1 billion USD
            in ETH or in ERC20) then this smart contract automatically allocates
            funds to be distributed as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>$1,107,000 for public goods funding</li>
            <li>
              $1,107,000 to reward one end-user (in 369 hours-cycle and/or 369
              days-cycle)
            </li>
            <li>$369,000 for the Community & Developers Benefit Fund</li>
            <li>$1,107,000 to help sustain u369.eth (the social good)</li>
          </ul>
